# nba_machine_learning
In this project, we used machine learning with NBA player data as well as championship and salary information to determine if we can predict which factors are most important in determining a championship calibar player. 
We used jupyter notebooks for cleaning the data and running our machine learning algoithms. 
We then furthered our insight with tableau to visualize these factors on a player by player basis.
